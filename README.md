✨ Flow charts with Git integration ✨

`debug-flow` is a developer tool for creating interactive flow charts to visualize and document debugging processes, with built-in Git integration to track your progress alongside your code.

Ever found yourself lost in a complex debugging session, forgetting which paths you've explored and which assumptions you have tested?

`debug-flow` provides a visual canvas to map out your debugging steps, hypotheses, and conclusions. By linking these flow charts to your Git history, you can create a powerful, versioned record of your debugging journey.
